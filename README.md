# fastatools

## fastatools.pl

General purpose FASTA filtering and statistics script.  


## fastatools.py

An implementation of the FASTA script in python.  

## retreive_from_fasta.pl
retrieve a sequence or a list of sequences from a FASTA file without the need to format a database.  


# NOTES
* These scripts are not memory efficient.  They read in an entire FASTA file.  This is good for speed, but require enough RAM to hold the FASTA file.
